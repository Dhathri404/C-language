# 🌱 My C Programming Practice

Hello there! 👋  
I'm Lekhya, 1st year CSE aiml student.
This repo is where I put all the C programs I write as I learn the language step by step.  
It’s basically my learning notebook — but in code!

## 📚 What’s inside:
- 🐣 Basic programs – printing, variables, data types  
- 🔁 Loops & conditions – if-else, for, while  
- 🧠 Functions and arrays – practicing logic building  
- 💡 Small exercises and experiments I try while learning

I’ll keep adding more code here as I learn new topics.  
Feel free to look around, try the programs, or even suggest better ways to write them!

✨ Learning in progress…
